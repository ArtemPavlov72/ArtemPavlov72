I'm interested in projects with modern technology stack, where I can get commercial development experience, as well as get the opportunity to work in a cool team.
In addition, I continue to improve my English with native teacher and I would like to continue to participate in an international team.
I am considering a remote work and companies with the possibility of relocation.
