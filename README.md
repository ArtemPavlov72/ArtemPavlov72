### Hi there!
My name is Artem ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior IOS developer with over 1.5 years of experience in IOS development. 

I finished courses on Swiftbook.ru as an IOS developer, where I wrote a project on the studied stack:
Swift, UIKit, MVC, URLSession, Async Await, Alamofire, Realm, CoreData, UserDefaults, restAPI, JSON, ARC, Storyboard, noStoryboard, OOP, SOLID, Git, HIG.

Then I continued studying Swift language by my self, working with pet projects. One of them - MyPexels. 
Stack used in the project: Swift, UIKit, MVC -> MVVM, URLSession, SDWebImage, SnapKit, CoreData, UserDefaults, restAPI, JSON, ARC, noStoryboard, OOP, SOLID, Git, HIG (and in future I will add Tests).

I successfully finished internship at Aston (ex. Andersen), where I wrote the crypto wallet project.

I am interested in projects with modern technology stack, where I can get commercial development experience, expand and deepen my knowledge in patterns such as MVVM, VIPER and CleanSwift, as well as get the opportunity to work in a team.

In addition, I continue to improve my English with native teacher and I would like to continue to participate in an international team.

I am considering a remote work and companies with the possibility of relocation.
